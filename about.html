        <p>
            I am a passionate, highly creative person with focus on a physical and tactile experience. I come from a long line of printing press operators, which I take pride in. I, however, was not trained by my family and have come into this passion on my own. I found my own mentors and learned mainly through trial and error over many years. In photography, I have a more standard education and earned an Associates degree in Visual Arts & Design with an emphasis on photography.

            I am drawn to manual technology, which is what I feel attracts me to letterpress printing. My photography, however, has advanced into the digital age. Both facets of my creative side are approached with great care and given a lot of thought. It’s about working with presence and intention. It’s about giving myself an experience while also providing others with an experience.
